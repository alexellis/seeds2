> A Python application for live tweeting photos of your seeds

* Get the Roboto font from:

https://material.io/guidelines/resources/roboto-noto-fonts.html

* For scheduling the code - use `cron` and this entry:

```
*/10 08-20 * * * /home/pi/seeds2/seed-it.sh
```

That runs once every 10 minutes between 8am and 8pm.
